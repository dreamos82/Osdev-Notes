[![Discord Chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/578193015433330698.svg?style=flat)](https://discordapp.com/channels/578193015433330698/578193713340219392)

This repository is a collection of small documents with notes about several topics related to Osdev.

They are not meant to be complete (maybe one day they will be), they are just personal notes, i will keep updating them while developing the OS

They are divided by topic, and usually in addition to information widely available on internet i try also to add information based on personal experience, advice received, or mistakes made. 

I hope that someone will find them useful. 

Topics covered so far: 

* [Drawing text on framebuffer](DrawingTextOnFB.md)
* [Environment setup (for a 64bit os)](EnvironmentSetup.md)
* [Multiboot](Multiboot.md)
* [Framebuffer](Framebuffer.md)
* [Moving the kernel in the higher half](HigherHalf.md)
* [Interrupt handling (64 bit)](IntterruptHandling.md)
* [Nasm tips](Nasm.md)
* [Memory Management](Memory_Management/)
    * [Paging](Paging.md)
    * [Memory Allocation](Memory_Management/Heap_Allocation.md)
    * [Physical Memory](Memory_Management/PhysicalMemory.md)
* [Global Descriptor Table](GDT.md)
* [APIC](APIC.md)
* [Keyboard](Keyboard.md)
* [Timer](Timer.md)
* [Debugging](Debug.md)
* [RSDP_and_RSDT](RSDP_and_RSDT.md)
* [C Language tips and tricks](C_Language_Info.md)
* [TroubleShooting](Troubleshooting.md)

Again they not mean to be complete, and are more a place where i try to keep things that i don't want to forget.
