# IDT

Although the IDT in long mode is pretty similar to the IA32 one, there are few differences. I'll try to cover them in this document.

## IDT Entry Structure

First important difference, is that while the IA32 idt entry is 64 bit, in long mode is 128 bit, and the structure is little bit different. 

This is how a idt entry structure looks like more or less: 
```C 
typedef struct IDT_desc {
   uint16_t offset;
   uint16_t segment_selector;
   uint8_t ist; //only first 2 bits are used, the rest is 0
   uint8_t flags; //P(resent) DPL (0) TYPE
   uint16_t offset_2;
   uint32_t offset_3;
   uint32_t reserved;
} __attribute__((__packed__))IDT_descriptor;
```

Where: 
* offset, offset_2 and offset_3 are the base address of interrupt handling function
* segment_selector: it indicates the selector for the destination code segment (specified in the GDT)
* ist: only the first 4 bits are used it is the interrupt stack table
* flags: it contains several information (from bit 0 to 8): 
    * Type, 4 bits it indicates the type of the IDT entry, in this case has to be 14 (this value indicate a 64 bit interrupt gate)
    * The next bit is always 0
    * DPL two bits, it can be 0 if handling cpu interrupts/exceptions
    * P one bit, present flag, if set to 1 this means the interrupt gatae is present.
    
In total the cpu can handle 256 interrupts, so you need to create an array of the structure above containing 256 elements: 

```C 
IDT_descript idt_table[256]; 
```

The layout of the idt table is specified by the following table: 

|  #idx | ID  | Description                           | Type     | ErrorCode |
|-------|-----|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
|   0   | #DE | Divide Error                          | Fault    |     No    | 
|   1   | #DB | RESERVED                              | Fault    |     No    |
|   2   |  -  | NMI Interrupt                         | Interrupt|     No    |
|   3   | #BP | Breakpoint                            | Trap     |     No    |
|   4   | #OF | Overflow                              | Trap     |     No    |
|   5   | #BR | BOUND Range Exceeded                  | Fault    |     No    |
|   6   | #UD | Invalid Opcode                        | Fault    |     No    | 
|   7   | #NM | Device not available                  | Fault    |     No    |
|   8   | #DF | Double Fault                          | Abort	 |   Yes (0) |
|   9   |     | Coprocessor segment overrun (reserved)| Fault	 |     No    |
|   10  | #TS | Invalid TSS                           | Fault    |    Yes    |
|   11  | #NP | Segment Not Present                   | Fault    |    Yes    |
|   12  | #SS | Stack-Segment Fault                   | Fault    |    Yes    |
|   13  | #GP | General Protection                    | Fault    |    Yes    |
|   14  | #PF | Page Fault                            | Fault    |    Yes    |
|   15  |     | Reserved                              |          |     No    |
|   16  | #MF | x87FPU Floating-Point Err (Math Fault)| Fault    |     No    |
|   17  | #AC | Alignment Check                       | Fault    |   Yes (0) |
|   18  | #MC | Machine Check                         | Abort    |     No    | 
|   19  | #XF | SIMD Floating point Exception         | Fault    |     No    |
| 20-31 |     | Reserved                              |          |           |
| 32-255|     | User defined (non reserved)interrupts | Interrup |           |


To correctly enable interrupts handling on our OS we need to do basically two steps:

* Populate an IDT vector
* Load it's address on a special register called IDTR

## Saving and restoring context

There are few things to keep in mind: 

* The first some exception contains also an error code and some not (the error code will be on the stack)
* Unfortunately the compiler is not helping us in this scenario, and it triest to optimize the code, so part of the exception handling has to be done using assembly
* In 64bit mode... the *PUSHA* instruction is gone :(
* Another difference (maybe in this case an improvement), registers pushed on the stack when passing the control to the handler now are always the same, no matter we are doing a privilege level change or not. 

So when passing the control to the handler the following registers are always pushed on the stack: 

|        |
|--------|
| SS     |
| RSP    |
| RFLAGS |
| CS     |
| RIP    |


## Misc Notes
If you want to halt the cpu, and interrupts are enabled, be sure to use `hlt` inside of a loop.
Otherwise when the cpu receives an interrupt, the halt flag will be cleared in order to execute the handler, 
and isn't restored. Therefore when you exit the interrupt, if not inside a loop, you'll start executing junk data after the halt!

What you're after:
```c
while(true)
    asm("hlt");
```
